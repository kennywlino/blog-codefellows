## Crafting a Standout Personal Brand

### What is a personal brand?

Personal brand is our story. It includes our expertise, skills, personality, tone of voice, and how we present ourselves.

It can also be defined as "the reputation you forge in the eyes of others through what you consistently say and do."

### How do you make your brand authentically you?

Creating a personal brand should not be something that we have to work hard to do. If it's difficult, it might be because we're not presenting ourselves authentically.

Things we should take into consideration when making our personal brand include: 

- your core character strengths: the qualities you demonstrate
- your skill sets and competencies: the things you're good at and enjoy
- your unique factor -- what allows you to add value and stand out

To create your personal brand, you can do an Authentic Personal Brand Audit by asking the following four questions.

1. How do you perceive yourself?

    What are your top 6 strengths? e.g. integrity, reliability, resourcefulness, creativity, leadership, critical thinking etc.

    Also refer to [Professional Competencies](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/common/professional-competencies) for a good list.

    What makes you stand out?

    Are you a high performer? Do you have a unique professional background? Skills from other industries or outside of work? Do you have awards, certificates or other forms of recognition?

2. How do others perceive you?

    Try asking some trusted professional colleagues or friends that know you well and ask them the same questions from above.

3. How aligned is your perception of yourself and others perceive you?

    Does how you perceive yourself align with how others see you? How are they different and what can you do to close the gap?

4. Where do you want to go in your career next?

    Think about where you want to be in the long-term. This will help you focus attention on the things you need to do and the qualities you need to hone in.

### Learning how to tell your story

The way you talk about your personal story can shape how others will receive it.

According to Dan McAdams, a psychology professor, "People who believe their lives are meaningful tend to tell stories defined by growth, communion, and agency". That means that we must be able to take ownership of our story and write it in a coherent and compelling way. To do this, we must assess the keypoints in our career and decide how these events have led us to today.

Here's a framework that the author provides to take control of your story called the 3Ps.

1. Protagonist

    - Where are you in your journey?
    - What do you want people to remember about you?

2. Path

    - What put you on your current path?
    - What were some of the bumps you had along the way?
    - Have you received any awards or recognition?
    - How has the experiences you had along the way shape you now?

3. Pinnacle purpose

    - Where do you want to go?
    - What is your future path?
    - What authentic qualities do you want people to recognize about you?

### Having a brand statement

When we interact with others professional, we're often in the position of describing what we do for work. We might answer with something like, "I'm a Lead Software Developer at XYZ Company".

However, reframing our answer by considering our audience and being able to communicate our skills and passion allows others to understand a lot more about our brand. 

A useful template to follow is:

"I [common tasks or work you do] using [key qualities] to [impact or cause positive outcome]."

For example:

"I'm a product manager that leads efforts to maximize customer engagement with our product utilizing my relational strengths. I handle communications between our designers and marketing team to create successful ad campaigns."

You can use these in e-mails or at networking events to better introduce yourself.
