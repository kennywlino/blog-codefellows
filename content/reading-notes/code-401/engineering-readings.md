## Why this topic matters

This topic goes over how to approach problem solving as a programmer and what to do to keep making progress. This topic is important as we prepare to encounter challenges as we prepare for our tech careers.

## Discussion Questions

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

For me, I would say the one thing I bring to this career that nobody else can is my experience in multiple cultures and disciplines. Being multi-racial helps me navigate spaces with a much broader mindset for diversity, and having experience in disciplines like linguistics and natural language processing helps prepare me in knowing how to communicate effectively and also the tech industry to a certain extent. I think coming from a more humanities-based discipline also allows me to break down coding and programming in a way that's more communicable.

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

When I get stuck on a tough task I plan to:

1. Make sure I've broken down the task into more mangeable sub-tasks. Research a subtask via Google/StackOverflow if necessary.

2. Test with very minimally working logic; e.g. how does the logic work if n = 1; n = 2?

3. Take a step away to start fresh.
