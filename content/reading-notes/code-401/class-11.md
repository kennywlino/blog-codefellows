## Event Driven Programming

Based on [Event-Driven Programming in Node.js](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-event-driven-programming) from DigitalOcean.

1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

    Node.js provides us with the *EventEmitter* module.

2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

    Object-oriented programming centers around the idea of creating objects to handle behavior of a single object within the object. With OOP, we can imagine multiple objects that can interact with each other based on various events that get triggered.

3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

    Event Driven Programming can handle actions behind our various clicks, button pushes, etc. in the browser. For example, when we click 'Send' on an e-mail, that triggers an event behind the scenes to update another person's inbox. When we click 'Submit' on an application, that can trigger an event. 

## Additional Questions

1. Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?

    I'm excited to see what message queues are and how event-driven programming will change our servers to be more expansive.

2. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

    My learning goals are to learn how to integrate EDP into our applications.
