## Why this topic matters

This topic matters because Node.js plays an integral part in allowing us to write and execute JavaScript in various places, including on our local machines, the browser and on a server.

## An introduction to Node.js

Based on this [Sitepoint.com article](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/).

Also see [Code 301, Class-06 notes](../code-301/class-06.md).

1. How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?

    I would describe Node as the system responsible for running and creating JavaScript programs.

2. What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?

    When we say Node is a JavaScript runtime, it describes where the JavaScript will be executed.

3. What is Node used for?

    Aside from being a JavaScript runtime, it's also frequently paired with npm, a package manager that allows us to use code created by others in our programs. Node can also be used for various tasks, such as working on the server, as a scripting language, and working with real-time data such as for chat sites or CodeShare.

## Additional Questions

I'm looking forward to learning how to set up various AWS products and learning about React functional components as well as React Native to see how we could make mobile apps.

2. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

After reading the class README, my learning goals are to become stronger with building industry-standard back-ends and as well as learning how to create clear and concise front-ends via React/React Native with supplementary learning in regards to styling and design.
