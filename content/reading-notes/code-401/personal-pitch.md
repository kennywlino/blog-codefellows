## Notes

- Golden circle (out to in): What, How, Why?

## Personal Pitch from 401 (12/2022)

Hi, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Kenny Lino.

Do you ever think about what to wear or how you present yourself?

I think about this a lot in the context of websites. Like people, you could say that there are websites that meticulously create an aesthetic with beautiful design and animations while there are others that are comfortable in a white T-shirt and jeans à la bootstrap.

I’m also interested in the human aspect of software engineering from making software with a people-first approach to solve real issues in minority communities to educating others in a way that breaks past the jargon and makes it relatable to them.

Having a background in linguistics and natural language processing also provides me with analytical and communication skills that translate into the tech space as I collaborate with others to problem solve business needs.

Along with my analytical skills, I strive to incorporate my creative energy by becoming a well-rounded full-stack developer that dreams about making fun and innovative applications that leave people with a lasting impression.

## Personal Pitch from 301 (10/2022)

Hi, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Kenny Lino.

My background is in linguistics and natural language processing.

Until recently, I was contracted as a Japanese linguist at Apple.
Perhaps you've had Siri misunderstand you or mispronounce something completely wrong. My team helped Siri achieve better pronunciation by adding coverage for 1000s of the top entities across media, celebrities, etc.

Now, I'm a software developer student at a coding boot camp, focused on learning full-stack web development.

Think about some of the websites or apps that you use. What are some that excite you? What are some that you avoid using?

For me, I became interested in thinking about development as the tool I used for work constantly had hiccups and made our work harder. When I compared my experience with my work tool vs. other apps I used daily, I realized that designing a well-functioning app is far from easy and takes understanding people's needs.

From there, I wanted to learn how to create exciting apps that provide people with a positive experience. Thus I've started my journey as a software developer.
