## Why this topic matters

Having a growth mindset is important not only in the tech world but also in life. While we can prepare as hard as possible during our time at Code Fellows, we will also have to prepare ourselves to continue to learn more even as we move up in our careers. Knowing how to accept that there will be challenges, and knowing that having failures can prepare us for success will help us want to continue to grow and not give up.

## Summary

Learning about how the desire to grow and having the grit to do it reminded me of my studies in language acquisition. In language acquisition, researchers investigate various factors that impact how people can learn langugage, whether as an adult or a baby. Some have argued that biology restricts us, while others have argued that it also depends on what motivates the learner. For those that might be learning for career reasons or other external motivators, as opposed to people who have a huge affinity for the culture of that langauge would end up having different levels of 'grit'. In this way, I think learning a language and wanting to put the time and effort into actually becoming fluent is very similar to learning programming and having the grit to tackle challenges.

## Emotional Intelligence Self-Assessment

My results on the [assessment](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/201/emotional-intelligence-assessment.pdf) were:

Self-Awareness: 20/25
Self-Management: 19/25
Social Awareness: 18/25
Relationship Management: 17/25

For me, I think it makes a lot of sense that my self-awareness score is the highest as I feel very confident about knowing how I feel and why. On the other hand, seeing my relationship management at a 17/25 made me realize that maybe it's an area that I could improve in. Of course, sometimes I find it harder to read and know what other people are thinking for sure hence I gave myself a couple of 3s in this category, but I think this also ties in to my social awareness score which shows that I should be more attentive. Moving forward, I'd like to be more considerate of others to be more socially aware and hold better relationships with others.

## Bias Self-Assessment

My results on the [Bias Self-Assessment](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/career_coaching/301/bias-assessment.pdf) were:

What is Bias: 14/15
Bias and Identity: 14/15
Bias and the Brain: 13/15
Connect to Mitigate Bias: 12/15
Empathy and Curiosity: 12/15
Meaningful Connections: 14/15
Effective Courage: 15/15
Four Ways to Act: 12/15

Comparing to my score from last time, it looks like my score has changed slightly with a point increase in "Empathy and Curiosity" and "Bias and the Brain". Specifically, my score for "I try to avoid unfamiliar people or situations, since that's often comfortable" under Empathy changed I'd say because Code 301 gave me a chance to work with people very different from me. My score for going with an objective assessment vs. my gut feeling also increased I think because I had a lot of practice problem solving recently as well. I will definitely continue to examine these areas to reduce my own personal bias even more so I can be better prepared for my future career.
