## Pinpoint Your Values

1. What motivates me to get up in the morning?

    For me, music often is the thing that motivates me to get up and start my day.

2. What keeps me up at night?

    The things that keep me up at night usually are the tasks that I wasn't able to get to during the day.

3. What am I doing when I'm at my best?

    When I'm at my best, I'd say that I'm talking about the things I'm doing at the moment with a lot of excitement and telling basically anybody that listens. I also likely lose track of time a lot more, and I'm eager to get to the next step.

4. Why am I bothered by what bothers me?

    In general, I'm bothered by things not going or working as expected. To give an example related to software, I'm reminded by the tooling we used at my previous job where we needed to add or update entries in a database using a front-end UI, but often times the actions would be far less than instantaneous. This made work for us a lot slower, and certainly less pleasant.

5. Why do I do the work I do?

    For me, when I started out my studies and career in linguistics, I was always curious about the human element. Language is something used by everyone in some form or fashion, so I not only wanted to learn every language in the world-- I also wanted to learn how language learning worked and how I could contribute to make learning languages easier for people especially when combining technology.

6. Why do I live where I live?

    I live in Seattle because it's one of the bigger cities on the west coast and because of the connections I've made here. Compared to moving somewhere less dense, I like living here because of all of the tech companies in the general area.

7. Why do I buy what I buy?

    I would say I tend to spend a bulk of my money on clothing and candy because they are two things that make me happy. I like to consider how I present myself, not just necessarily in the eyes' of others but also because I see it as a form of self-expression. Clothes can tell us a lot about each other, whether it's because we wear the same thing everyday or because we're wearing something gaudy and elegant.

8. Why do I long for what I long for?

    On a grand scheme of things, I long for the day where I've secured financial stability to the point that I can help others gain the same. I long for this in particular because life has often shown itself to be quite unpredictable and scary for those who don't have a back-up plan to fall back on.

    On a personal level not considering work and money, I long for the day that I can focus my energy and time on creativity in general. While I have time after work and on the weekends to pursue my creative interests like dance, I also would eventually like my career to take a more creative direction as well.

9. Why do I read and watch what I do?

    These days, during my personal time, I like to watch different anime like JoJo's Bizarre Adventure or Demon Slayer. When I'm in a more curious mood, I like to watch tutorials for creative coding with packages like three.js or just general design tutorials.

    I watch the anime partially as a reason to feel more connected to my identity as someone half-Japanese, but also because many of the characters in these shows do their best to persevere which inspires me.

    I watch the creative tutorials because I'm also interested in finding my own personal style in creating appealing front-ends and other visuals for people to interact with.

10. Why do I admire whom I admire?

    I admire a number of people from celebrities to fictional characters, including but not limited to people like Fran Drescher and Megan Thee Stallion who are unabashedly themselves. As I mentioned above, despite being fictional, I admire characters from the animes I watch like JoJo from JoJo's Bizzare Adventure or Itachi from Naruto because even though their journey's are hard, they never give up and do what they need to do to get to their destination.

11. When I am happy?

    For me, I am most happy when I'm doing something that's constructive and has positive impact on other people around me. That could mean anything from planning a successful event for my community, or creating applications with others that can help a certain audience or designing something fun and unique that leaves people wanting more.

12. Why do I have the relationships that I have?

    Many of the relationships I have now are because of the positive values these relationships bring to my life. For example, I've maintained a solid number of friendships with friends from university because my friends are also equally ambitious.

5. Study more (graphic) design and UI/UX to create visuals

### List your core values based on your answers to #1

Based on words from [James Clear Core Values List](https://jamesclear.com/core-values).

1. Creativity

2. Community

3. Happiness

4. Meaningful work

5. Humor

### What have you decided is your purpose?

Now, connect each opportunity with as many or few core values as apply. You’re looking for the opportunity that best matches your values.

I've decided that my purpose is to use my creativity to fuel my happiness and solve challenges in my communities to create meaningful or just fun work for people.

## Make Room For What You Love

### Maximize

1. Focus on creativity

2. Focus on community

3. Focus on learning software development to create meaningful/fun apps

### Minimize

1. Wasted time during the day so I don't worry about tasks I couldn't get to

2. Focus on less creative aspects of software development

3. Wasted money on items unrelated to my purpose

## Filter By Purpose

When you’re feeling out of sorts about what’s going on in your life, or if you’re trying to decide if a new opportunity fits your purpose, use these questions to filter through to an answer.

1. What core value does this fit with?
2. What level of excite do I have about this?
3. Will/does this distract from something else that is very important to me?
4. How might this play out in the future?
