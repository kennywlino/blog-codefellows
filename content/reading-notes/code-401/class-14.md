## Read Today's Lab Requirement

See [Lab Requirements](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-14/lab/)

1. Discuss 2 possible project ideas that could be completed by you and a partner in the alloted time.

    I like the idea of simulating a chatbot system that a user could interact with to do things like place an order, check on the status, or mark as missing.

    I also like the idea of building some form of a game like Hangman or a number guessing game as mentioned in the examples.
